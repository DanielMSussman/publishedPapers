@article{Angelini2011,
abstract = {Collective cell migration in tissues occurs throughout embryonic development, during wound healing, and in cancerous tumor invasion, yet most detailed knowledge of cell migration comes from single-cell studies. As single cells migrate, the shape of the cell body fluctuates dramatically through cyclic processes of extension, adhesion, and retraction, accompanied by erratic changes in migration direction. Within confluent cell layers, such subcellular motions must be coupled between neighbors, yet the influence of these subcellular motions on collective migration is not known. Here we study motion within a confluent epithelial cell sheet, simultaneously measuring collective migration and subcellular motions, covering a broad range of length scales, time scales, and cell densities. At large length scales and time scales collective migration slows as cell density rises, yet the fastest cells move in large, multicell groups whose scale grows with increasing cell density. This behavior has an intriguing analogy to dynamic heterogeneities found in particulate systems as they become more crowded and approach a glass transition. In addition we find a diminishing self-diffusivity of short-wavelength motions within the cell layer, and growing peaks in the vibrational density of states associated with cooperative cell-shape fluctuations. Both of these observations are also intriguingly reminiscent of a glass transition. Thus, these results provide a broad and suggestive analogy between cell motion within a confluent layer and the dynamics of supercooled colloidal and molecular fluids approaching a glass transition.},

@article{Baker1993,
abstract = {It has long been known that cells show reduced cell-substratum adhesion during mitosis in tissue culture, but it is not generally known whether cell-cell adhesion is also reduced. Epithelial cells, both in culture and in tissues, are linked together by several different types of intercellular junctions. Are these junctions disassembled when epithelial cells divide? Cultured epithelial cells were fluorescently stained for desmosomes, tight junctions and zonulae adherentes, and large numbers of dividing cells examined by light microscopy. The results suggested that all three types of intercellular junctions were retained throughout cell division and no evidence for internalization of junctions was obtained. The persistence of intercellular junctions by cultured cells during division was confirmed by electron microscopy. In order to determine whether intercellular junctions were similarly retained by dividing cells in tissues, human colonic mucosal crypt cells and basal keratinocytes were studied by electron microscopy. Both cell types retained intercellular junctions during division. Dividing basal keratinocytes also possessed hemidesmosomal contact with the basement membrane. It is suggested that retention of cellular junctions during division is important for maintenance of tissue integrity and organization.},

abstract = {We introduce an Active Vertex Model (AVM) for cell-resolution studies of the mechanics of confluent epithelial tissues consisting of tens of thousands of cells, with a level of detail inaccessible to similar methods. The AVM combines the Vertex Model for confluent epithelial tissues with active matter dynamics. This introduces a natural description of the cell motion and accounts for motion patterns observed on multiple scales. Furthermore, cell contacts are generated dynamically from positions of cell centres. This not only enables efficient numerical implementation, but provides a natural description of the T1 transition events responsible for local tissue rearrangements. The AVM also includes cell alignment, cell-specific mechanical properties, cell growth, division and apoptosis. In addition, the AVM introduces a flexible, dynamically changing boundary of the epithelial sheet allowing for studies of phenomena such as the fingering instability or wound healing. We illustrate these capabilities with a number of case studies.},

@article{Conlon2003,
abstract = {It is widely believed that cell-size checkpoints help to coordinate cell growth and cell-cycle progression, so that proliferating eukaryotic cells maintain their size. There is strong evidence for such size checkpoints in yeasts, which maintain a constant cell-size distribution as they proliferate, even though large yeast cells grow faster than small yeast cells. Moreover, when yeast cells are shifted to better or worse nutrient conditions, they alter their size threshold within one cell cycle. Populations of mammalian cells can also maintain a constant size distribution as they proliferate, but it is not known whether this depends on cell-size checkpoints. We show that proliferating rat Schwann cells do not require a cell-size checkpoint to maintain a constant cell-size distribution, as, unlike yeasts, large and small Schwann cells grow at the same rate, which depends on the concentration of extracellular growth factors. In addition, when shifted from serum-free to serum-containing medium, Schwann cells take many divisions to increase their size to that appropriate to the new condition, suggesting that they do not have cell-size checkpoints similar to those in yeasts. Proliferating Schwann cells and yeast cells seem to use different mechanisms to coordinate their growth with cell-cycle progression. Whereas yeast cells use cell-size checkpoints, Schwann cells apparently do not. It seems likely that many mammalian cells resemble Schwann cells in this respect.},

@article{Dolznig2004,
abstract = {Continuously proliferating cells exactly double their mass during each cell cycle. Here we have addressed the controversial question of if and how cell size is sensed and regulated. We used erythroblasts that proliferate under the control of a constitutively active oncogene (v-ErbB) or under the control of physiological cytokines (stem cell factor, erythropoietin and v-ErbB inhibitor). The oncogene-driven cells proliferated 1.7 times faster and showed a 1.5-fold increase in cell volume. The two phenotypes could be converted into each other 24 h after altering growth factor signalling. The large cells had a higher rate of protein synthesis, together with a shortened G1 phase. Additional experiments with chicken erythroblasts and mouse fibroblasts, synchronized by centrifugal elutriation, provided further evidence that vertebrate cells can respond to cell size alterations (induced either through different growth factor signalling or DNA synthesis inhibitors) by compensatory shortening of the subsequent G1 phase. Taken together, these data suggest that an active size threshold mechanism exists in G1, which induces adjustment of cell-cycle length in the next cycle, thus ensuring maintenance of a proper balance between growth and proliferation rates in vertebrates.},

@article{Farhadifar2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epithelial junctional networks assume packing geometries characterized by different cell shapes, neighbor number distributions and areas. The development of specific packing geometries is tightly controlled; in the Drosophila wing epithelium, cells convert from an irregular to a hexagonal array shortly before hair formation. Packing geometry is determined by developmental mechanisms that likely control the biophysical properties of cells and their interactions.

RESULTS: To understand how physical cellular properties and proliferation determine cell-packing geometries, we use a vertex model for the epithelial junctional network in which cell packing geometries correspond to stable and stationary network configurations. The model takes into account cell elasticity and junctional forces arising from cortical contractility and adhesion. By numerically simulating proliferation, we generate different network morphologies that depend on physical parameters. These networks differ in polygon class distribution, cell area variation, and the rate of T1 and T2 transitions during growth. Comparing theoretical results to observed cell morphologies reveals regions of parameter space where calculated network morphologies match observed ones. We independently estimate parameter values by quantifying network deformations caused by laser ablating individual cell boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS: The vertex model accounts qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed packing geometry in the wing disc and its response to perturbation by laser ablation. Epithelial packing geometry is a consequence of both physical cellular properties and the disordering influence of proliferation. The occurrence of T2 transitions during network growth suggests that elimination of cells from the proliferating disc epithelium may be the result of junctional force balances.},

@article{Garcia2015,
abstract = {Although collective cell motion plays an important role, for example during wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression, the fundamental rules governing this motion are still not well understood, in particular at high cell density. We study here the motion of human bronchial epithelial cells within a monolayer, over long times. We observe that, as the monolayer ages, the cells slow down monotonously, while the velocity correlation length first increases as the cells slow down but eventually decreases at the slowest motions. By comparing experiments, analytic model, and detailed particle-based simulations, we shed light on this biological amorphous solidification process, demonstrating that the observed dynamics can be explained as a consequence of the combined maturation and strengthening of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions. Surprisingly, the increase of cell surface density due to proliferation is only secondary in this process. This analysis is confirmed with two other cell types. The very general relations between the mean cell velocity and velocity correlation lengths, which apply for aggregates of self-propelled particles, as well as motile cells, can possibly be used to discriminate between various parameter changes in vivo, from noninvasive microscopy data.},

@article{Hufnagel2007,
abstract = {A fundamental and unresolved problem in animal development is the question of how a growing tissue knows when it has achieved its correct final size. A widely held view suggests that this process is controlled by morphogen gradients, which adapt to tissue size and become flatter as tissue grows, leading eventually to growth arrest. Here, we present evidence that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen distribution in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disk does not adapt to disk size. We measure the distribution of a functional Dpp-GFP transgene and the Dpp signal transduced by phospho-Mad and show that the characteristic length scale of the Dpp profile remains approximately constant during growth. This finding suggests an alternative scenario of size determination, where disk size is determined relative to the fixed morphogen distribution by a certain threshold level of morphogen required for growth. We propose that when disk boundary reaches the threshold the arrest of cell proliferation throughout the disk is induced by mechanical stress in the tissue. Mechanical stress is expected to arise from the nonuniformity of morphogen distribution that drives growth. This stress, through a negative feedback on growth, can compensate for the nonuniformity of morphogen, achieving uniform growth with the rate that vanishes when disk boundary reaches the threshold. The mechanism is demonstrated through computer simulations of a tissue growth model that identifies the key assumptions and testable predictions. This analysis provides an alternative hypothesis for the size determination process. Novel experimental approaches will be needed to test this model.},

@article{Kabla2012,
abstract = {A number of biological processes, such as embryo development, cancer metastasis or wound healing, rely on cells moving in concert. The mechanisms leading to the emergence of coordinated motion remain however largely unexplored. Although biomolecular signalling is known to be involved in most occurrences of collective migration, the role of physical and mechanical interactions has only been recently investigated. In this study, a versatile framework for cell motility is implemented in silico in order to study the minimal requirements for the coordination of a group of epithelial cells. We find that cell motility and cell-cell mechanical interactions are sufficient to generate a broad array of behaviours commonly observed in vitro and in vivo. Cell streaming, sheet migration and susceptibility to leader cells are examples of behaviours spontaneously emerging from these simple assumptions, which might explain why collective effects are so ubiquitous in nature. The size of the population and its confinement appear, in particular, to play an important role in the coordination process. In all cases, the complex response of the population can be predicted from the knowledge of the correlation length of the velocity field measured in the bulk of the epithelial layer. This analysis provides also new insights into cancer metastasis and cell sorting, suggesting, in particular, that collective invasion might result from an emerging coordination in a system where single cells are mechanically unable to invade.},

abstract = {Wound healing involves a coordinated series of tissue movements that bears a striking resemblance to various embryonic morphogenetic episodes. There are several ways in which repair recapitulates morphogenesis. We describe how almost identical cytoskeletal machinery is used to repair an embryonic epithelial wound as is involved during the morphogenetic episodes of dorsal closure in Drosophila and eyelid fusion in the mouse foetus. For both naturally occurring and wound-activated tissue movements, JNK signalling appears to be crucial, as does the tight regulation of associated cell divisions and adhesions. In the embryo, both morphogenesis and repair are achieved with a perfect end result, whereas repair of adult tissues leads to scarring. We discuss whether this may be due to the adult inflammatory response, which is absent in the embryo.},

abstract = {Embryonic development involves global changes in tissue shape and architecture that are driven by cell shape changes and rearrangements within cohesive cell sheets. Morphogenetic changes at the cell and tissue level require that cells generate forces and that these forces are transmitted between the cells of a coherent tissue. Contractile forces generated by the actin-myosin cytoskeleton are critical for morphogenesis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of contraction have been elusive for many cell shape changes and movements. Recent studies that have combined live imaging with computational and biophysical approaches have provided new insights into how contractile forces are generated and coordinated between cells and tissues. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the mechanical forces that shape cells, tissues, and embryos, emphasizing the different modes of actomyosin contraction that generate various temporal and spatial patterns of force generation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Our model includes three key ingredients observed across many epithelia, namely cell–cell adhesion, cell death and a cell division process that depends on the surrounding environment. We show a rich non-equilibrium phase diagram depending on the ratio of cell death to cell division and on the adhesion strength. For large apoptosis rates, cells die out and the tissue disintegrates. As the death rate decreases, however, we show, consecutively, the existence of a gas-like phase, a gel-like phase, and a dense confluent (tissue) phase. Most striking is the observation that the tissue is self-melting through its own internal activity, ruling out the existence of any glassy phase.},

As the dimensionless {\{}target shape index{\}} {\$}s{\_}0 = \backslashfrac{\{}P{\_}0{\}}{\{}\backslashsqrt{\{}A{\_}0{\}}{\}}{\$} is varied we find a transition from a soft elastic regime for compatible target perimeter and area to a stiffer nonlinear elastic regime frustrated by geometric incompatibility. We show that the ground state in the soft regime has a family of degenerate solutions associated with zero modes for the target area and perimeter respectively. The onset of geometric incompatibility at a critical {\$}s{\_}0{\^{}}c{\$} lifts this degeneracy. The resultant energy gap leads to a very different more rigid nonlinear elastic response beyond that described by classical elasticity models.

abstract = {From coffee beans flowing in a chute to cells remodelling in a living tissue, a wide variety of close-packed collective systems—both inert and living—have the potential to jam. The collective can sometimes flow like a fluid or jam and rigidify like a solid. The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly understood, however, and structural properties characterizing these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly, the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell–cell adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural signature for classification and investigation of bronchial epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics play a prominent role.},

@article{Passucci2019,
abstract = {We seek to characterize the motility of mouse fibroblasts on 2D substrates. Utilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are super-diffusive, where displacements scale faster than t1/2 in all directions. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such statistics in other cell types: run and tumble behavior with L{\'{e}}vy-distributed run times, and ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We develop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the predictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities such as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions are equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs, which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the run times are not L{\'{e}}vy distributed. The analysis tools developed here should be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for superdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.},

@article{Puliafito2012,
abstract = {Control of cell proliferation is a fundamental aspect of tissue physiology central to morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer. Although many of the molecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth is still poorly understood. A simple form of inhibition of cell proliferation is encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures and is known as "contact inhibition." The study presented here provides a quantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and single cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells we demonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows inhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local expansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and cell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change across the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing cell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising through reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of cell size, and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area falls below a critical value. We also present a simple computational model of growth mechanics which captures all aspects of the observed behavior. Our measurements and analysis show that contact inhibition is a consequence of mechanical interaction and constraint rather than interfacial contact alone, and define quantitative phenotypes that can guide future studies of molecular mechanisms underlying contact inhibition.},

abstract = {During the formation of tissues, cells organize collectively by cell division and apoptosis. The multicellular dynamics of such systems is influenced by mechanical conditions and can give rise to cell rearrangements and movements. We develop a continuum description of tissue dynamics, which describes the stress distribution and the cell flow field on large scales. In the absence of division and apoptosis, we consider the tissue to behave as an elastic solid. Cell division and apoptosis introduce stress sources that, in general, are anisotropic. By combining cell number balance with dynamic equations for the stress source, we show that the tissue effectively behaves as a viscoelastic fluid with a relaxation time set by the rates of division and apoptosis. If the system is confined in a fixed volume, it reaches a homeostatic state in which division and apoptosis balance. In this state, cells undergo a diffusive random motion driven by the stochasticity of division and apoptosis. We calculate the expression for the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the tissue parameters and compare our results concerning both diffusion and viscosity to simulations of multicellular systems using dissipative particle dynamics.},

@article{Rosenblatt2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Simple epithelia encase developing embryos and organs. Although these epithelia consist of only one or two layers of cells, they must provide tight barriers for the tissues that they envelop. Apoptosis occurring within these simple epithelia could compromise this barrier. How, then, does an epithelium remove apoptotic cells without disrupting its function as a barrier? RESULTS We show that apoptotic cells are extruded from a simple epithelium by the concerted contraction of their neighbors. A ring of actin and myosin forms both within the apoptotic cell and in the cells surrounding it, and contraction of the ring formed in the live neighbors is required for apoptotic cell extrusion, as injection of a Rho GTPase inhibitor into these cells completely blocks extrusion. Addition of apoptotic MDCK cells to an intact monolayer induces the formation of actin cables in the cells contacted, suggesting that the signal to form the cable comes from the dying cell. The signal is produced very early in the apoptotic process, before procaspase activation, cell shrinkage, or phosphatidylserine exposure. Remarkably, electrical resistance studies show that epithelial barrier function is maintained, even when large numbers of dying cells are being extruded. CONCLUSIONS We propose that apoptotic cell extrusion is important for the preservation of epithelial barrier function during cell death. Our results suggest that an early signal from the dying cell activates Rho in live neighbors to extrude the apoptotic cell out of the epithelium.},

@article{Saraswathibhatla2019,
abstract = {Key to collective cell migration is the ability for cells to rearrange their position with respect to their neighbors. One factor identified by experiments to affect cell rearrangement is the number density of cells in the monolayer. This experimental observation contrasts with recent theoretical models, which suggest that changes in cellular rearrangements result from cell forces rather than number density. The theory demonstrated that rearrangements and forces are related through cell shape, with cells having more elongated shapes and greater perimeters more easily sliding past their neighbors within the cell layer. Though it is thought that cell perimeter is affected primarily by adhesion and cortical tension at cell's periphery, experimental testing of this hypothesis has produced conflicting results. Here we studied collective migration in an epithelial monolayer by measuring cell forces, perimeters, and motion, and found all three to decrease with either increased density or inhibition of cell contraction. In contrast to previous understanding, the data suggest that cell shape and rearrangements are driven neither by density nor by forces at the cell periphery but rather by tractions at the cell-substrate interface. This observation is confirmed by an experiment that shows increasing tractions reverses the effect of density on cell shape and rearrangements. These findings reconcile observations of experiments and theory and establish cell-substrate traction, rather than cell-cell force, as a dominant physical factor controlling shape and motion in collective cell migration.},

abstract = {Many biological tissues are viscoelastic, behaving as elastic solids on short timescales and fluids on long timescales. This collective mechanical behaviour enables and helps to guide pattern formation and tissue layering. Here, we investigate the mechanical properties of three-dimensional tissue explants from zebrafish embryos by analysing individual cell tracks and macroscopic mechanical response. We find that the cell dynamics inside the tissue exhibit features of supercooled fluids, including subdiffusive trajectories and signatures of caging behaviour. We develop a minimal, three-parameter mechanical model for these dynamics, which we calibrate using only information about cell tracks. This model generates predictions about the macroscopic bulk response of the tissue (with no fit parameters) that are verified experimentally, providing a strong validation of the model. The best-fit model parameters indicate that although the tissue is fluid-like, it is close to a glass transition, suggesting that small changes to single-cell parameters could generate a significant change in the viscoelastic properties of the tissue. These results provide a robust framework for quantifying and modelling mechanically driven pattern formation in tissues.},

@article{Shraiman2005,
abstract = {Regulation of cell growth and proliferation has a fundamental role in animal and plant development and in the progression of cancer. In the context of development, it is important to understand the mechanisms that coordinate growth and patterning of tissues. Imaginal discs, which are larval precursors of fly limbs and organs, have provided much of what we currently know about these processes. Here, we consider the mechanism that is responsible for the observed uniformity of growth in wing imaginal discs, which persists in the presence of gradients in growth inducing morphogens in spite of the stochastic nature of cell division. The phenomenon of "cell competition," which manifests in apoptosis of slower-growing cells in the vicinity of faster growing tissue, suggests that uniform growth is not a default state but a result of active regulation. How can a patch of tissue compare its growth rate with that of its surroundings? A possible way is furnished by mechanical interactions. To demonstrate this mechanism, we formulate a mathematical model of nonuniform growth in a layer of tissue and examine its mechanical implications. We show that a clone growing faster or slower than the surrounding tissue is subject to mechanical stress, and we propose that dependence of the rate of cell division on local stress could provide an "integral-feedback" mechanism stabilizing uniform growth. The proposed mechanism of growth control is not specific to imaginal disc growth and could be of general relevance. Several experimental tests of the proposed mechanism are suggested.},

@article{Streichan2014,
abstract = {Control of cell proliferation is a fundamental aspect of tissue for- mation in development and regeneration. Cells experience various spatial and mechanical constraints depending on their environ- mental context in the body, but we do not fully understand if and how such constraints influence cell cycle progression and thereby proliferation patterns in tissues. Here, we study the impact of mechanical manipulations on the cell cycle of individual cells within a mammalian model epithelium. By monitoring the response to experimentally applied forces, we find a checkpoint at the G1–S boundary that, in response to spatial constraints, controls cell cycle progression. This checkpoint prevents cells from entering S phase if the available space remains belowa characteristic threshold because of crowding. Stretching the tissue results in fast cell cycle reactiva- tion, whereas compression rapidly leads to cell cycle arrest. Our kinetic analysis of this response shows that cells have no memory of past constraints and allows us to formulate a biophysical model that predicts tissue growth in response to changes in spatial con- straints in the environment. This characteristic biomechanical cell cycle response likely serves as a fundamental control mechanism to maintain tissue integrity and to ensure control of tissue growth during development and regeneration. cell},

abstract = {In order to understand the mechanisms for glassy dynamics in biological tissues and shed light on those in non-biological materials, we study the low-temperature disordered phase of 2D vertex-like models. Recently it has been noted that vertex models have quite unusual behavior in the zero-temperature limit, with rigidity transitions that are controlled by residual stresses and therefore exhibit very different scaling and phenomenology compared to particulate systems. Here we investigate the finite-temperature phase of two-dimensional Voronoi and Vertex models, and show that they have highly unusual, sub-Arrhenius scaling of dynamics with temperature. We connect the anomalous glassy dynamics to features of the potential energy landscape associated with zero-temperature inherent states.},

@article{Thompson1995,
abstract = {In multicellular organisms, homeostasis is maintained through a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Although much is known about the control of cell proliferation, less is known about the control of cell death. Physiologic cell death occurs primarily through an evolutionarily conserved form of cell suicide termed apoptosis. The decision of a cell to undergo apoptosis can be influenced by a wide variety of regulatory stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in cell survival contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, including cancer, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Treatments designed to specifically alter the apoptotic threshold may have the potential to change the natural progression of some of these diseases.},

@article{Trepat2009,
abstract = {Fundamental biological processes including morphogenesis, tissue repair and tumour metastasis require collective cell motions1, 2, 3, and to drive these motions cells exert traction forces on their surroundings4. Current understanding emphasizes that these traction forces arise mainly in 'leader cells' at the front edge of the advancing cell sheet5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Our data are contrary to that assumption and show for the first time by direct measurement that traction forces driving collective cell migration arise predominately many cell rows behind the leading front edge and extend across enormous distances. Traction fluctuations are anomalous, moreover, exhibiting broad non-Gaussian distributions characterized by exponential tails10, 11, 12. Taken together, these unexpected findings demonstrate that although the leader cell may have a pivotal role in local cell guidance, physical forces that it generates are but a small part of a global tug-of-war involving cells well back from the leading edge.},

@article{Weeks2002,
abstract = {The dynamics of a glass-forming material slow greatly near the glass transition, and molecular motion becomes inhibited. We use confocal microscopy to investigate the motion of colloidal particles near the colloidal glass transition. As the concentration in a dense colloidal suspension is increased, particles become confined in transient cages formed by their neighbors. This prevents them from diffusing freely throughout the sample. We quantify the properties of these cages by measuring temporal anticorrelations of the particles' displacements. The local cage properties are related to the subdiffusive rise of the mean square displacement: over a broad range of time scales, the mean square displacement grows slower than linearly in time.},

@article{Yang2017,
abstract = {Collective cell migration is a highly regulated process involved in wound healing, cancer metastasis, and morphogenesis. Mechanical interactions among cells provide an important regulatory mechanism to coordinate such collective motion. Using a self-propelled Voronoi (SPV) model that links cell mechanics to cell shape and cell motility, we formulate a generalized mechanical inference method to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of cellular stresses from measured traction forces in motile tissues and show that such traction-based stresses match those calculated from instantaneous cell shapes. We additionally use stress information to characterize the rheological properties of the tissue. We identify a motility-induced swim stress that adds to the interaction stress to determine the global contractility or extensibility of epithelia. We further show that the temporal correlation of the interaction shear stress determines an effective viscosity of the tissue that diverges at the liquid-solid transition, suggesting the possibility of extracting rheological information directly from traction data.},
