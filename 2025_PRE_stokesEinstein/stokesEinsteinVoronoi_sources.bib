@article{Li2019,
	abstract = {Long-wavelength elastic modes, which have an infinitesimal energy cost, destroy the long-range translational order of 2D solids at finite temperatures. Here we demonstrate that these long-wavelength fluctuations also influence the dynamical properties of 2D systems in their normal liquid regimes. Hence, long-wavelength fluctuations make 2- and 3D molecular particulate systems behave differently from high- to very low-temperature regimes. In 2-dimensional systems at finite temperature, long-wavelength Mermin--Wagner fluctuations prevent the existence of translational long-range order. Their dynamical signature, which is the divergence of the vibrational amplitude with the system size, also affects disordered solids, and it washes out the transient solid-like response generally exhibited by liquids cooled below their melting temperatures. Through a combined numerical and experimental investigation, here we show that long-wavelength fluctuations are also relevant at high temperature, where the liquid dynamics do not reveal a transient solid-like response. In this regime, these fluctuations induce an unusual but ubiquitous decoupling between long-time diffusion coefficient D and structural relaxation time τ, where D∝τ−κ, with κ\&gt;1. Long-wavelength fluctuations have a negligible influence on the relaxation dynamics only at extremely high temperatures in molecular liquids or at extremely low densities in colloidal systems.},

@article{Nath2024,
	abstract = {It has been recognized of late that even amorphous, glass-forming materials in two dimensions (2D) are affected by Mermin--Wagner-type long wavelength thermal fluctuation, which is inconsequential in three dimensions (3D). We consider the question of whether the effect of spatial dimension on dynamics is only limited to such fluctuations or if the nature of glassy dynamics is intrinsically different in 2D. To address it, we study the relationship between dynamics and thermodynamics using the Adam--Gibbs (AG) relation and the random first order transition (RFOT) theory. Using two model glass-forming liquids, we find that even after removing the effect of long wavelength fluctuations, the AG relation breaks down in two dimensions. Next, we consider the effect of anharmonicity of vibrational entropy---a second factor that affects the thermodynamics but not dynamics. Using the potential energy landscape formalism, we explicitly compute the configurational entropy, both with and without the anharmonic correction. We show that even with both the corrections, the AG relation still breaks down in 2D. The extent of deviation from the AG relation crucially depends on the attractive vs repulsive nature of interparticle interactions, choice of representative timescale (diffusion coefficient vs α-relaxation time), and implies that the RFOT scaling exponents also depend on these factors. Thus, our results suggest that some differences in the nature of glassy dynamics between 2D and 3D remain that are not explained by long wavelength fluctuations.},

@article{Choi2017,
	abstract = {Self-diffusion in a two-dimensional simple fluid is investigated by both analytical and numerical means. We investigate the anomalous aspects of self-diffusion in two-dimensional fluids with regards to the mean square displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) using a consistency equation relating these quantities. We numerically confirm the consistency equation by extensive molecular dynamics simulations for finite systems, corroborate earlier results indicating that the kinematic viscosity approaches a finite, non-vanishing value in the thermodynamic limit, and establish the finite size behavior of the diffusion coefficient. We obtain the exact solution of the consistency equation in the thermodynamic limit and use this solution to determine the large time asymptotics of the mean square displacement, the diffusion coefficient, and the VACF. An asymptotic decay law of the VACF resembles the previously known self-consistent form, , however with a rescaled time.},

@article{Chisolm2024,
	abstract = {Transitions between solid-like and fluid-like states in living tissues have been found in steps of embryonic development and in stages of disease progression. Our current understanding of these transitions has been guided by experimental and theoretical investigations focused on how motion becomes arrested with increased mechanical coupling between cells, typically as a function of packing density or cell cohesiveness. However, cells actively respond to externally applied forces by contracting after a time delay, so it is possible that at some packing densities or levels of cell cohesiveness, mechanical coupling stimulates cell motion instead of suppressing it. Here we report our findings that at low densities and within multiple ranges of cell cohesiveness, cell migration speeds increase with these measures of mechanical coupling. Our observations run counter to our intuition that cell motion will be suppressed by increasingly packing or sticking cells together and may provide new insight into biological processes involving motion in dense cell populations.},

@article{Pandey2025,
	abstract = {The glass-like slow dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers is crucial for wound healing{,} embryogenesis{,} cancer progression{,} etc. Experiments have indicated several unusual properties in these systems. Unlike ordinary glasses{,} the glassiness in cellular systems strongly correlates with their static properties and is sub-Arrhenius. These results imply that the slow dynamics in epithelial monolayers is either not glassy or the underlying mechanism is different from ordinary glasses. Combining the analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT){,} vertex model simulations{,} and cellular experiments{,} we show that the slow dynamics is glassy{,} though the mechanism differs from ordinary glasses. The structure-dynamics feedback mechanism of MCT{,} and not the barrier-crossing mechanism{,} dominates the glassy dynamics{,} where the relaxation time diverges as a power law with a universal exponent 3/2 and naturally explains the sub-Arrhenius relaxation. Our results suggest the possibility of describing various complex biological processes like cell division and apoptosis via the static properties of the systems{,} such as average cell shape or shape variability.},

@book{Berthier2011DHBook,
	abstract = {Most of the solid materials we use in everyday life, from plastics to cosmetic gels exist in a non-crystalline, amorphous form: they are glasses. Yet, we are still seeking a fundamental explanation as to what glasses really are, why they form, and what their properties are. This book surveys the most recent theoretical and experimental research dealing with the physics of glassy and disordered materials, from molecular fluids to colloidal glasses, granular media and foams. Chapters present broad and original perspectives on one of the deepest mystery of condensed matter physics, with a particular emphasis on the key role played by dynamic heterogeneities to understand from a unified viewpoint phenomena occurring in scores of disordered materials. The book covers both fundamental aspects, and reviews extensively several recent theoretical developments in the field of the glass transition that have changed our view of the glass transition. It also provides an up-to-date perspective on new experimental tools that have been developed to study with unprecedented resolution the structural relaxation of systems like molecular and polymer liquids, colloidal glasses, foams and granular materials. It also confronts, discusses, compares, and challenges the different perspectives actively promoted by different research groups and communities in a very active area of condensed-matter and statistical physics.},
