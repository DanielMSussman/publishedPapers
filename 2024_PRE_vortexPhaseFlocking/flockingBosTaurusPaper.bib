abstract = {The study was to focus on the relationship between wave motion (mass sperm motility, measured by a mass sperm motility score, manually assessed by artificial insemination (AI) center operators) and fertility in male sheep. A dataset of 711,562 artificial inseminations performed in seven breeds by five French AI centers during the 2001–2005 time period was used for the analysis. Factors influencing the outcome of the insemination, which is a binary response observed at lambing of either success (1) or failure (0), were studied using a joint model within each breed and AI center (eight separate analyses). The joint model is a multivariate model where all information related to the female, the male and the insemination process were included to improve the estimation of the factor effects. Results were consistent for all analyses. The male factors affecting AI results were the age of the ram and the mass motility. After correction for the other factors of variation, the lambing rate increased quasi linearly from three to more than ten points with the mass sperm motility score depending on the breed and the AI center. The consistency of the relationship for all breeds indicated that mass sperm motility is predictive of the fertility resulting when sperm are used from a specific ejaculate. Nonetheless, predictability could be improved if an objective measurement of mass sperm motility were available as a substitute for the subjective scoring currently in use in AI centers.}

Incubation of sperm with heparin (10 μg/ml) increased the percentage of oocytes fertilized, but this required exposing sperm to heparin for at least 4 h before adding them to oocytes. There was no effect on the percentage of motile or acrosome-reacted sperm after exposure of noncapacitated sperm to 100 μg/ml LC for 15 min. When sperm were incubated for 4 h with heparin, exposure to 100 μg/ml LC for 15 min had no effect on the percentage of sperm that were motile, but the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm increased from less than 10\\% to over 70\\%. The acrosome reactions (ARs) induced by LC were synchronous, reached maximal levels within 15 min, and differed (p\\&lt;0.001) between sperm incubated under capacitating (with heparin) and noncapacitating conditions (without heparin). The time course required for heparin to capacitate sperm as judged by in vitro fertilization and to render sperm sensitive to LC induction of the AR were found to be similar. The percentage of ARs induced by LC and percentage of oocytes fertilized by sperm were found to be heparin-dose-dependent, with the maximum responses occurring at 5–10 μg/ml heparin. The correlation between the mean fertilization and LC-induced AR percentages was 0.997 (p\\&lt;0.01). These studies demonstrate capacitation of bovine sperm by heparin requires at least a 4-h exposure of sperm to heparin and suggest that plasma membrane changes prior to an AR can be detected by exposure of bovine sperm to LC.}",

abstract = {Semen processed with procedures intended to permit a flexible thaw method is used to breed millions of cows yearly. One method of thawing straws, the “pocket thaw” is used extensively with semen prepared with these procedures. Published field data is lacking for thaw method comparisons with semen processed to permit flexible-thawing. The objective of the present study was to measure the effect of semen thaw method (warm-water or pocket thaw) over all seasons and its interaction with herds, inseminators, straw package size, and sperm number on conception rate in commercial dairy heifer herds using semen processed with procedures historically optimized for success with flexible-thawing. Professional inseminators performed 11,215 services over a 16-month period in four large herds, achieving a 67.6% conception rate. Thaw method was alternated weekly. Thaw effect on conception status, determined by 70 days non-return rate, was estimated by a generalized linear mixed model. Neither thaw method nor number of sperm per straw significantly affected probability of conception (P=0.658 and 0.769, respectively). No interactions of thaw method with herd, sperm number, season, straw size, and straw size by season were detected (P=0.297, 0.526, 0.365, 0.723, and 0.824, respectively). Bull, herd, inseminator within herd, year, season, and straw size affected conception rate (P=0.002, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, and 0.014, respectively). In conclusion, for semen processed with procedures that permit flexible-thawing, thaw method (pocket thaw versus warm-water thaw) did not affect conception rate under commercial conditions and with routine semen handling methods.}

    abstract = { Obstructed by hurdles in information extraction, handling and processing, computer-assisted sperm analysis systems have typically not considered in detail the complex flagellar waveforms of spermatozoa, despite their defining role in cell motility. Recent developments in imaging techniques and data processing have produced significantly improved methods of waveform digitization. Here, we use these improvements to demonstrate that near-complete flagellar capture is realizable on the scale of hundreds of cells, and, further, that meaningful statistical comparisons of flagellar waveforms may be readily performed with widely available tools. Representing the advent of high-fidelity computer-assisted beat-pattern analysis, we show how such a statistical approach can distinguish between samples using complex flagellar beating patterns rather than crude summary statistics. Dimensionality-reduction techniques applied to entire samples also reveal qualitatively distinct components of the beat, and a novel data-driven methodology for the generation of representative synthetic waveform data is proposed. }

	abstract = {Bacterial processes ranging from gene expression to motility and biofilm formation are constantly challenged by internal and external noise. While the importance of stochastic fluctuations has been appreciated for chemotaxis, it is currently believed that deterministic long-range fluid dynamical effects govern cell{\textendash}cell and cell{\textendash}surface scattering{\textemdash}the elementary events that lead to swarming and collective swimming in active suspensions and to the formation of biofilms. Here, we report direct measurements of the bacterial flow field generated by individual swimming Escherichia coli both far from and near to a solid surface. These experiments allowed us to examine the relative importance of fluid dynamics and rotational diffusion for bacteria. For cell{\textendash}cell interactions it is shown that thermal and intrinsic stochasticity drown the effects of long-range fluid dynamics, implying that physical interactions between bacteria are determined by steric collisions and near-field lubrication forces. This dominance of short-range forces closely links collective motion in bacterial suspensions to self-organization in driven granular systems, assemblages of biofilaments, and animal flocks. For the scattering of bacteria with surfaces, long-range fluid dynamical interactions are also shown to be negligible before collisions; however, once the bacterium swims along the surface within a few microns after an aligning collision, hydrodynamic effects can contribute to the experimentally observed, long residence times. Because these results are based on purely mechanical properties, they apply to a wide range of microorganisms.},

ABSTRACT={Collective swimming is evident in the sperm of several mammalian species. In bull (Bos taurus) sperm, high viscoelasticity of the surrounding fluid induces the sperm to form dynamic clusters. Sperm within the clusters swim closely together and align in the same direction, yet the clusters are dynamic because individual sperm swim into and out of them over time. As the fluid in part of the mammalian female reproductive tract contains mucus and, consequently, is highly viscoelastic, this mechanistic clustering likely happens in vivo. Nevertheless, it has been unclear whether clustering could provide any biological benefit. Here, using a microfluidic in vitro model with viscoelastic fluid, we found that the collective swimming of bull sperm in dynamic clusters provides specific biological benefits. In static viscoelastic fluid, clustering allowed sperm to swim in a more progressive manner. When the fluid was made to flow in the range of 2.43–4.05 1/sec shear rate, clustering enhanced the ability of sperm to swim upstream. We also found that the swimming characteristics of sperm in our viscoelastic fluid could not be fully explained by the hydrodynamic model that has been developed for sperm swimming in a low-viscosity, Newtonian fluid. Overall, we found that clustered sperm swam more oriented with each other in the absence of flow, were able to swim upstream under intermediate flows, and better withstood a strong flow than individual sperm. Our results indicate that the clustering of sperm can be beneficial to sperm migrating against an opposing flow of viscoelastic fluid within the female reproductive tract.}

    abstract = "{The shape of the flagellar beat determines the path along which a sperm cell swims. If the flagellum bends periodically about a curved mean shape then the sperm will follow a path with non-zero curvature. To test a simple hydrodynamic theory of flagellar propulsion known as resistive force theory, we conducted high-precision measurements of the head and flagellum motions during circular swimming of bull spermatozoa near a surface. We found that the fine structure of sperm swimming represented by the rapid wiggling of the sperm head around an averaged path is, to high accuracy, accounted for by resistive force theory and results from balancing forces and torques generated by the beating flagellum. We determined the anisotropy ratio between the normal and tangential hydrodynamic friction coefficients of the flagellum to be 1.81±0.07 (mean±s.d.). On time scales longer than the flagellar beat cycle, sperm cells followed circular paths of non-zero curvature. Our data show that path curvature is approximately equal to twice the average curvature of the flagellum, consistent with quantitative predictions of resistive force theory. Hence, this theory accurately predicts the complex trajectories of sperm cells from the detailed shape of their flagellar beat across different time scales.}",

    abstract = "{The rotational movement of a spermatozoon around its longitudinal axis was investigated by two methods: by observing a spermatozoon attached vertically to a coverslip by the tip of its head, and by observing a spermatozoon freely swimming in a medium by means of ‘double-focal microscopy’, which yielded simultaneous images at two different focal planes.Similar results were obtained by these two methods. Sea urchin, starfish, medaka, human, golden hamster and bull spermatozoa rolled in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, although there was a large difference in the proportion of spermatozoa rolling in each direction in the different species. The majority of sea urchin and starfish spermatozoa rolled in a clockwise direction when an observer viewed the cell from its anterior end, whereas the majority of medaka, golden hamster, human and bull spermatozoa rolled in a counterclock-wise direction relative to the same observer. Moreover, some spermatozoa occasionally changed their rotational direction.These results suggest that the mechanism regulating the direction of rotation of the spermatozoa is lax. As rotational movement of a spermatozoon around its longitudinal axis is due to the three-dimensional component of the beat of the flagellum, the direction of the three-dimensional movement presumably changes as the spermatozoa swim.}",
